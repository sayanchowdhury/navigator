Zulip
=====

Zulip is a group chat app. Its most distinctive characteristic is that
conversation within an organization is divided into “streams” and further
subdivided into “topics”, so that much finer-grained conversations are possible
than with IRC or other chat tools.

PyCon India over the years has switched between multiple chat platforms, which
brought it's own set of disadvantages. Losing the existing knowledge base was one
of them. Each year, the team spent a substantial amount of time learning and
setting a new platform.

PyCon India 2019 team, went ahead with the Zulip setup and it was discussed that
the future teams would stick to this platform.


Streams and Topics
------------------

As mentioned earlier, Zulip is divided into `streams` and `topics`. Streams are
analogous with streams, and folks can have multiple conversation in a stream,
categorizing them into topics.


Stream Names
------------

There are two types of streams used in the context of PyCon India:

- Fixed: The `Fixed` streams are the ones which don't change over the years. The
  same stream is used by the incoming teams and volunteers. This helps to retain and referring
  to the conversations by the older teams.

  The format of the streams are as follows:

.. code-block::

  #wg/<WG name>

  Few examples include:

  #wg/design
  #wg/program
  #wg/promotion
  #wg/technology

- Change: The `Change` streams are streams which are created every year. These
  streams are created every year.

  The format of the streams are as follows

.. code-block::

  #<year>/<stream_name>

  Few examples include:

  #2021/announcements
  #2021/coc


Topics
------

When creating the streams it is always better to include few of these topics.

- General
- Announcements
- Meetings

`General` is a must topic to have. This is the place where most conversation can
happen. Refrain from creating unduly new ones, this creates a chaos. A lot of
general conversation can happen in the `General` topic.
